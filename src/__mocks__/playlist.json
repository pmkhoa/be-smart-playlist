				"description": "Why the abstraction of mathematics is so fundamental\n\nWatch the next lesson: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/introduction-to-algebra/overview_hist_alg/v/descartes-and-cartesian-coordinates?utm_source=YT&utm_medium=Desc&utm_campaign=AlgebraI\n\nMissed the previous lesson? \nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/introduction-to-algebra/overview_hist_alg/v/abstract-ness?utm_source=YT&utm_medium=Desc&utm_campaign=AlgebraI\n\nAlgebra I on Khan Academy: Algebra is the language through which we describe patterns. Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a \"gatekeeper\" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy is a nonprofit with a mission to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. We believe learners of all ages should have unlimited access to free educational content they can master at their own pace. We use intelligent software, deep data analytics and intuitive user interfaces to help students and teachers around the world.

While Europe was indeed having some issues, many other parts of the world were thriving and relatively enlightened. John covers European Feudalism, the cultural blossoming of the Islamic world, and the scientific and artistic advances in China, all during these \"Dark Ages.\" Along the way, John will raise questions about the validity of Europe's status as a continent, reveal the best and worst years of his life, and frankly state that science and religion were once able to coexist.\n\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@realjohngreen\n@raoulmeyer\n@crashcoursestan\n@saysdanica\n@thoughtbubbler\n\nLike us! â€ªhttp://www.facebook.com/youtubecrashcourse\nFollow us again! â€ªhttp://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com Support CrashCourse on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse",

				"description": "Ideas like liberty, freedom, and self-determination were hot stuff in the late 18th century, as evidenced by our recent revolutionary videos. Although freedom was breaking out all over, many of the societies that were touting these ideas relied on slave labor. Few places in the world relied so heavily on slave labor as Saint-Domingue, France's most profitable colony. Slaves made up nearly 90% of Saint-Domingue's population, and in 1789 they couldn't help but hear about the revolution underway in France. All the talk of liberty, equality, and fraternity sounds pretty good to a person in bondage, and so the slaves rebelled. This led to not one but two revolutions, and ended up with France, the rebels, Britain, and Spain all fighting in the territory. Spoiler alert: the slaves won. So how did the slaves of what would become Haiti throw off the yoke of one of the world's great empires? John Green tells how they did it, and what it has meant in Haiti and in the rest of the world.\n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD! http://store.dftba.com/products/crashcourse-world-history-the-complete-series-dvd-set\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@realjohngreen\n@raoulmeyer\n@crashcoursestan\n@saysdanica\n@thoughtbubbler\n\nLike us! â€ªhttp://www.facebook.com/youtubecrashcourse\nFollow us again! â€ªhttp://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com\nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse",

I find Worthington jets fascinating.  They are very similar to what's happinging during the Munroe Effect.  \n\nThe Camera used is a Vision Research Phantom.

				"title": "Penn Jillette: Don't Leave Atheists Out on Christmas",
				"description": "Atheist magician Penn Jillette questions Christian logic and the so-called War on Christmas:  \"Why leave me out?  Why do that?  What's your motive?  And trying to turn around a 'we want to leave you out,' into 'why are you forcing us to not have our joy,' is insanity.  It's backwards.\"\n\nTranscript--\nI don't think there's any attack against Christmas.  I think that seeing including other people in a seasonal joy, how can that be seen as an attack?  Maybe the greatest speech of our time, most probably the greatest speech of our time, is Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech.  What Martin Luther King does in that speech, Martin Luther King was a religious man.  Martin Luther King was a Reverend.  He says in that speech, he doesn't say this is just for Christians, he says it's for everybody.  He doesn't use the word \"Christian\" anywhere in the speech. He does refer to a God, he does say:  \"Free at last, Lord, Lord,\" but he is quoting a Spiritual.  He was a preacher who spoke in churches and yet when it was important to bring other people in, the, I have a Dream speech speaks to me, it speaks to atheists.\n\nAnd I don't care if you're talking about Walgreen's, if you're talking about sending out Christmas cards or your setting up something on a town square.  Why do you want to leave people out?  Why is it considered an attack to say \"holidays,\" to say \"seasonal?\"  I mean, don't you want other people to join you in joy? Why are you excluding other people?  I don't think there should be any sort of, you're not allowed to say Christmas.  I think you're fine putting up your trees.  I think you're fine talking about Santa Claus and you're fine talking about Jesus Christ, about equal to me.  But why leave me out?  Why do that?  What's your motive?  And trying to turn around a \"we want to leave you out,\" into \"why are you forcing us to not have our joy,\" is insanity.  It's backwards.  \n\nSo sure, sure, say Christmas, but you're leaving out right about now close to 30 percent of the population of the United States of America that you are telling, I'm not talking to you.  Why can't you just say, it's a beautiful season, we all love each other.  Let's all have a good time.  Why is that terrible?   I also think that the war on -- I mean, I would love to take the Christ out of Christmas.  I mean, I would love that.  I would love there to be a time of the year where everybody came together.  I mean, there's something that's happened in this country over the past, well 100 years, but really over the past 50 years, where this word \"Christian\" has become more important.  The early part of the 20th century, the late part of the 19th century, you had Baptists, you has Southern Baptists, you had Methodists, you had Congregationalists, you had Catholics, you had, you know, all these different kind of little sects.  You had Baptists and Southern Baptists and then Joe's Baptist and you know, Bill's Bait Shop and Baptist, you know, you had all these little groups.  And they were all kind of warring.  And then in many people's opinion, in order to fight abortion, to get a consensus and a strong group to fight that, they kind of adopted this word \"Christian,\" which isn't used much, even before Jimmy Carter, you know.  \n\nThe word, \"Christian\" to count the Catholics and the Protestants and all the Protestants all together and that allows them to say stuff like Christian Nation and allowed them to say stuff.  Because if you take each sect individually, well, non-religious is one of the biggest ones.  You have to do all of the Christians together, throw them all together to get this 60, 70 percent. \nSo I just think they should keep going.  Why stop at Christian?  Why not keep going to American?  Why not make the Christmas time of the year an American holiday and really include all Americans?  And then we keep going, why not include all people.  I mean, I don't see why you want to close people out.  It's your right to close people out; it's your right to have a club that people can't belong to.  But, why do you want to do it?  Why not just give a smile and welcome us in?  Welcome us into your stores, make a buck.  Welcome us into your homes, have a laugh.  You know, welcome us everywhere.  \n\nAnd doing holiday instead of Christmas brings everybody in.  Doesn't seem that terrible, but I certainly don't think there should be anything legal stopping people from saying all the Christmas stuff they want.  I am more in favor of freedom of religion than anyone I've ever met.  I am -- I think you should have all the prayer meetings you want all the time with any religion you have.  I'd rather you didn't do it on my dime.  I'd rather you do it on your own with the people that agree with you.\n\nDirected / Produced by Jonathan Fowler & Elizabeth Rodd",

				"description": "Why should you bother to wake up tomorrow knowing that we're all going to die billions and billions of years from now when the universe turns to absolute zero, when the stars blink out, when we have nothing but neutron stars and black holes? Dr. Kaku says that billions of years from now we may be able to move to a different universe.\n\nTranscript -- In cosmology we believe that the universe started off in a big bang 13.7 billion years ago.  All alternatives have been pretty much ruled out.  Steady state theories, other alternatives have been ruled out.  However, how will the universe end?  We have several possibilities.  One possibility is a big crunch when the universe squashes together in a gigantic ball of flame and maybe bangs once again.  Another possibility is the big freeze, that the universe expands and just keeps on going and we're all going to freeze to death and we're all going to die when the universe reaches near absolute zero.  Then there is something called the big rip where the universe goes into an exponential expansion and expands so rapidly that the distant galaxies can no longer be seen because they travel faster than the speed of light, that even the distant galaxies break the light barrier, and that's called the big rip, meaning that the night sky will be totally black except for some of the nearby stars.  \n\nWhich of the three alternatives is the fate of the universe?  Well, the short answer is we don't know.  However, what we do know is that the universe is undergoing an exponential runaway expansion.  The universe at the present time is careening out of control.  Every astronomy textbook says that there was a big bang.  The universe is expanding, but it's slowing down.  It also says that the universe is mainly made out of atoms.  Every textbook says that.  The universe is made out of atoms.  The universe is expanding, but slowing down.  Both are wrong.  We have to rewrite every single high school textbook on the planet earth.  The universe is not mainly made out of atoms.  \n\nFour percent of the universe is made out of atoms, just four percent.  23% is made out of dark matter.  73%, which makes up most of the universe, is dark energy, and unfortunately, we are clueless as to what dark energy is and what dark matter is.  In fact, if you ever find out what dark energy and dark matter is, be sure to tell me first.  \n\nNow why is that important?  Because the amount of matter and energy in the universe determines the rate of expansion.  We now know there is a lot more dark energy than we previously thought.  Therefore, the universe is undergoing an inflationary exponential expansion.  It is in a runaway mode, but here is the catch: we don't know how long that runaway mode is going to last.  Some people say that it's temporary.  We're in this huge expansion right now, exponential expansion, but it's going to reverse itself.  Instead of a red shift, we'll have a blue shift as the universe collapses.  At the present time we simply don't know.  Why don't we know?  Because we don't know what dark energy is.  In fact, if you were to try to write down a theory of dark energy, your number would not correspond to the data by a mismatch of 10 to the 120.  That is the largest mismatch in the history of science.  There is no mismatch bigger than 10 to the 120.  So this is a mystery.  Until we solve the mystery of dark energy, we do not know the ultimate fate of the universe.  \n\nMy personal thoughts are that perhaps we will continue with this exponential expansion and perhaps go into a big rip mode and at that point all intelligent life in the universe will die.  All the tears and all the struggles and all the heartbreak of humanity since we rose from the swamp, it's all for nothing.  Why should you bother to wake up tomorrow knowing that we're all going to die billions and billions of years from now when the universe turns to absolute zero, when the stars blink out, when we have nothing but neutron stars and black holes?  What does it all mean anyway, if we're all going to die in a big rip?\n\nWell, my personal attitude is that when the universe is about to die, why not leave the universe?  Trillions of years from now, we will have the ability to bend space and time into a pretzel.  We'll be able to tie space into knots.  We'll be what is called a type three, maybe a type four civilization, a galactic civilization with the capability of harnessing galactic power.  At that point, when the universe becomes so cold that all life is freezing to death, I say let us escape the universe, go into hyperspace and go to another universe.\n\nDirected / Produced by Jonathan Fowler and Elizabeth Rodd",

				"title": "Michio Kaku: Can Nanotechnology Create Utopia?",
				"description": "Dr. Kaku addresses the question of the possibility of utopia, the perfect society that people have tried to create throughout history. These dreams have not been realized because we have scarcity. However, now we have nanotechnology, and with nanotechnology, perhaps, says Dr. Michio Kaku, maybe in 100 years, we'll have something called the replicator, which will create enormous abundance. \n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/dr-kakus-universe/can-nanotechnology-create-utopia\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/bigthink\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript:\nThroughout human history people have tried to create utopia, the perfect society.  In fact, America, the American dream, in some sense was based on utopianism.  Why do we have the Shaker movement?  Why did we have the Quakers?  Why did we have so many different kinds of religious movements that fled Europe looking to create a utopia here in the Americas?  Well, we know the Shakers have disappeared and many of these colonies have also disappeared only to be found in footnotes in American textbooks, and the question is why?\n\nOne reason why is scarcity because back then the industrial revolution was still young and societies had scarcity.  Scarcity creates conflict and unless you have a way to resolve conflict, your colony falls apart.  How do you allocate resources?  Who gets access to food when there is a famine?  Who gets shelter when there is a snowstorm and all of the sudden you've eaten up your seed corn?  These are questions that faced the early American colonists, and that's the reason why we only see the ghost towns of these utopias.  \n\nHowever, now we have nanotechnology, and with nanotechnology, perhaps, who knows, maybe in 100 years, we'll have something called the replicator.  Now the replicator is something you see in Star Trek.  It's called the molecular assembler and it takes ordinary raw materials, breaks them up at the atomic level and joins the joints in different ways to create new substances.  If you have a molecular assembler, you can turn, for example, a glass into wood or vice versa.  You would have the power of a magician, in fact, the power of a god, the ability to literally transform the atoms of one substance into another and we see it on Star Trek.\n\nIt's also the most subversive device of all because if utopias fail because of scarcity then what happens when you have infinite abundance?  What happens when you simply ask and it comes to you?  One of my favorite episodes on Star Trek is when the Enterprise encounters a space capsule left over from the 20th century, the bad 20th century.  People died of all these horrible diseases, and many people froze themselves knowing that in the 23rd century or so they'll be thawed out and their diseases will be cured.  Well, sure enough, it's the 23rd century now.  The Enterprise finds a space capsule and begins to revive all these people and cure them of cancer, cure them of incurable genetic diseases, and then one of these individuals, however, was a banker.  He is revived and he says to himself, \"My God, my gamble worked; I'm alive; I'm in the 23rd century,\" and he said, \"Call my stock broker; call my banker; I am rich; I am rich; my investments, they have been sitting there in the bank for centuries; I must be a quadrillionaire!\"  And then the crew of the Enterprise looks at this man and says, \"What is money; what is a bank; what is a stock broker?  We don't have any of these in the 23rd century,\" and then they say, \"If you want something, you simply ask for it and you get it.\"\n\nNow that's subversive.  That's revolutionary because if all utopian societies vanished because of scarcity and conflict, what happens when there is no scarcity?  What happens when you simply ask and you get what you want?  This has enormous philosophical implications.  For example, why bother to work?  Why bother to go to work when you simply ask for things and it comes to you?",

				"description": "Where should NASA go to look for intelligent life on Mars? To get to the truth, journalists say follow the money. Astronomers say follow the water. Dr. Michio Kaku says \"if you were a Martian on Mars three billion years ago when Mars was probably a lush environment with liquid water oceansâ€”and you realized that the water was escaping to the icecaps, escaping into outer space or going into the permafrost,\" then you would \"probably go either into outer space to leave Mars or drill into the permafrost or go into the polar icecaps. So I think that's what NASA is going to do next.\"\n\nOriginally recorded August 9, 2012.\n\nTranscript--\n\nDr. Michio Kaku: Congratulations to NASA!  NASA scored a gold medal on Mars, a ten.  It was a perfect launch, perfect execution, and the dismount was a perfect ten on the Red Planet.  But that's just the first step of many steps to come.  Next we want to go to perhaps the polar icecaps or perhaps even drill underground.  \n\nIf you were a Martian on Mars three billion years ago when Mars was practically aâ€”probably a lush environment with liquid water oceansâ€”and you realized that the water was escaping to the icecaps, escaping into outer space or going into the permafrost, where would you go?  Journalists say follow the money.  Astronomers say follow the water.  And if the water is going to go into outer space, underground or the polar icecaps, you would also probably go either into outer space to leave Mars or drill into the permafrost or go into the polar icecaps.  So I think that's what NASA is going to do next.  Of course, it's more difficult to land on the polar icecaps because the terrain is quite rocky.  \n\nAlso, rock retrieval; we need to actually take rocks from Mars and bring them back to earth because we have tantalizing evidence that possibly microbial life existed on Mars.  We have Mars rocks right here on the planet earth, and when you slice them open you see little tiny, squiggly things that look like multi-celled organisms.  Well, we're not sure.  It's a raging debate.  Some people say bah-humbug, it's nothing but a crystalline structure that seems to look like a multi-cell organism.  The result of the question is we have to have rock retrieval and after that I think perhaps we should put a blimp or a helicopter on Mars.  Now the atmosphere of Mars is quite thin, only one percent the atmospheric pressure here on the planet earth, so the wings of the helicopter or the size of a blimp would have to be different to compensate for that.  \n\nAnd then of course we should try for a manned mission to Mars.  But let's be real.  It's going to be expensive and it will take time.  It costs $10,000 to put a pound of anything into near earth orbit.  Imagine your body made out of solid gold and that's the cost to put you into orbit around the planet earth.  To put you on the moon costs about $100,000 a pound.  To put you on Mars costs about a million dollars a pound.  So think twice before you think that we're going to go to Mars with astronauts in the next few years.  It's going to take decades to prepare for a manned mission to Mars.\n\nDirected / Produced by\nJonathan Fowler and Elizabeth Rodd\n\nhttp://bigthink.com/",

Support your local PBS Member Station here: https://to.pbs.org/donateidea\n\nDoes Santa Have more in Common with Hulk Hogan than St. Nick?\n\nPeople love Santa. Christmas is the largest holiday in western culture, and Santa Claus is the centerpiece of that holiday (sorry baby Jesus). But even though our understanding of Santa changes as we mature, we still maintain and cultivate our culture's love of him. And to understand why this is, we had to ask: Is our relationship with Santa similar to wrestling? Though (SPOILER) wrestling is more entertainment than sport, we still enjoy watching it. So it begs the question are Santa, Hulk Hogan and the Rock more similar than different??!??
